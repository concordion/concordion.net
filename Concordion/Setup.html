<h2>Setup</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> To kickstart this tutorial, we've created a "Hello World!" project
          with the following structure. </p>
        <p> Download: <a href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion-net-kickstart/releases/latest"
            target="_top">concordion-net-kickstart.zip</a> </p>
        <img alt="Structure" src="../image/project-structure.jpg">
        <p> It contains the latest stable version of Concordion.NET, all its
          dependencies, and a simple "Hello World!" example. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>"Greeter.cs" is the class we want to test</li>
          <li>"Kickstart.Spec" is a Visual Studio project for the specifications
            and acceptance tests. Unit tests are typically held in a project
            ending with "Test" but we prefer the name "Spec", for the Concordion.NET
            acceptance tests, to emphasize the fact that these tests are
            concerned with <span style="font-style: italic;">external behavior</span>.
          </li>
          <li>"HelloWorldTest.cs" is a Concordion.NET test fixture class. We'll
            explain how this works, below.</li>
          <li>"HelloWorld.html" is the Concordion.NET specification and is processed
            by the <code>"HelloWorldTest.cs"</code> fixture. The name of the
            fixture and the HTML file share the same base name. The fixture has
            an optional suffix of "Test" - for example, it may be named
            "HelloWorld.cs" or "HelloWorldTest.cs".</li>
          <li>"concordion.css" is a stylesheet to make the specs look nice while
            you're writing them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Concordion.NET requires the .NET framework with version 3.5 or
          higher. You have to add the following references to your project: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Concordion.dll</li>
			<li>Concordion.NET.dll</li>
			<li>IKVM.*.dll</li>
          <li>OGNL.dll</li>
			<li>xom.dll</li>
          <li>nunit.framework.dll (version 2.6.4)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be able to 
		<a href="http://concordion.org/dotnet/RunningTests.html" target="_top">run the Concordion.NET
            tests with NUnit</a> you need to make the Concordion-NUnit addin
          available to your installation of NUnit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>copy Concordion.NUnit.dll to &lt;nunit-2.6.4-installation-path&gt;\bin\addins\</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These dependencies are included in the distribution.</p>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A Concordion.NET executable specification consists of two parts: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>a well-formed XHTML document describing the functionality, and </li>
          <li>fixture code written in C#&nbsp; that relies on concrete examples 
		  from the specification document and uses them to verify the system under test.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Both files must be in the same package. In order for the magic to
          happen, the document must first be <em>instrumented</em> with
          commands. Concordion.NET commands are specified as attributes on elements
          in the XHTML document. Web browsers ignore attributes that they don't
          understand, so these commands are effectively invisible. </p>
        <p> The commands use a <code>"concordion"</code> namespace defined at
          the top of each document as follows: </p>
        <pre class="html">&lt;html xmlns:concordion="http://www.concordion.org/2007/concordion"&gt;
</pre>
</body>
</html>
