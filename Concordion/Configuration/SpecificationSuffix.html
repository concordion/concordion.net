    <h3>File extensions for specification documents</h3>
	<p>Per default Concordion.NET assumes that specification documents have the 
	file extension &quot;.html&quot;. With the <code>SpecificationFileExtensions</code> 
	you can define which file extensions you want to use for your specification 
	documents. You can even use several in parallel. This can be useful, when 
	you are in the transition from one type of files to another (e.g. from html 
	to xhtml).</p>
	<p>To specify that html as well as xhmtl files should be considered as 
	Concordion.NET specifications, you need to add the following configuration 
	settings to your configuration:</p>
	<pre class="html">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;Specification&gt;
  &lt;SpecificationFileExtensions&gt;
    &lt;FileExtension name=&quot;html&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;FileExtension name=&quot;xhtml&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/SpecificationFileExtensions&gt;
&lt;/Specification&gt;</pre>
